		Booth's multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies 
		two signed binary numbers in two's complement notation. The algorithm was invented by Andrew 
		Donald Booth in 1950 while doing research on crystallography at Birkbeck College in Bloomsbury, 
		London. Booth used desk calculators that were faster at shifting than adding and created the 
		algorithm to increase their speed. Booth's algorithm is of interest in the study of computer architecture.[1]
